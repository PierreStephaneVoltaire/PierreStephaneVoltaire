### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Full-Stack Developer with 3 years of experience.

- I developed backend applications using libraries and frameworks such as Flask, Spring Boot, NestJS and Express.

- I modeled entities, queried and manipulated information stored in SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, as well as NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, to support mobile-friendly websites as well as mobile applications.

I'm confortable with Angular and Vue (but recently have been working with React)
I'm more of a Typescript/Golang/Rust dev but am really intersted in getting into devops
